## 0:00 - 0:30 | The Hook: "Why Most Investors Fail"

**(Action: Start with your face on camera or the Landing Page. Speak clearly and passionately.)**

"I've been investing in the equity markets for more than 8 years. And to be honest, I found myself unable to even beat the index funds.

When I researched this, I realized it's not just me. **91% of retail investors lose money.**

Why? Because we are outgunned. Wall Street has teams of analysts; we have day jobs.

That's why I built **EquityPulse**. It is a **Hedge Fund in Your Pocket**."

## 0:30 - 1:00 | The Analysis: "Real-Time Agent Reasoning"

**(Action: Switch to Dashboard. Type 'NVDA' (NVIDIA) in the search bar and click Analyze.)**

"Let me give you a demo. Let's run an analysis for one of our favorites: the AI giant, **NVIDIA**.

**(Action: As the agents start working, point to the log panel showing real-time updates.)**

You can see the logs in real-time. This isn't a chatbot making things up; these are specialized agents—Fundamental, Quant, Risk, Technical—tracing their reasoning and debating the stock live."

---

## 1:00 - 1:30 | The Portfolio Manager & Technicals

**(Action: Once analysis completes, scroll to the 'Portfolio Manager Summary' at the top.)**

"Once it's done, you see the **Portfolio Manager's Summary**. It aggregates everything.
For example, it gives an **8/10 on Valuation** because it weighs the growth against the premium.

**(Action: Scroll down to the Technical Analysis section.)**

Let's look at the **Technical Analysis**. You see the Simple Moving Averages (SMA), RSI, MACD, and other indicators charted right here. It gives you the *relative* strength, not just the price action."

---

## 1:30 - 2:00 | The Deep Dive: "50+ Parameters vs. Simple Ratios"

**(Action: Scroll to Fundamental Analysis section.)**

"Now, the **Fundamental Analysis**.
Most people only look at basic parameters like P/E ratios. Those are subjective and often misleading.

We consider **50+ Quantitative parameters** and hundreds of qualitative items.

**(Action: Point out the Green/Yellow/Red color coding on the metrics.)**

We verify these facts against the actual report. You can visually see the health of the company:
*   **Green**: Good.
*   **Yellow**: Moderate.
*   **Red**: Dangerous.

This applies across all our agents."

---

## 2:00 - 2:30 | The Missing Link: "Qualitative Analysis"

**(Action: Scroll to Sector and Management Analysis sections.)**

"This is where 90% of investors fail: **Sector & Management Analysis**.

Fundamentals tell you *what happened*. Sector analysis tells you *what's coming*—business cycles, headwinds, and tailwinds.

And **Management Analysis** is crucial. We assess qualitative terms—geopolitical risks, leadership integrity—that numbers simply miss."

## 2:30 - 3:00 | Multimodal Features & Closing

**(Action: Highlight text on the report to show the Annotation tool.)**

"We also have smart **Annotations**. You can highlight any text in the report to instantly ask the agent for clarification.

**(Action: Click the Microphone icon. Speak a short query like 'Summarize the risks'.)**

We use **Gemini 3.0 Flash** for our Voice-to-Text feature. It instantly converts speech into actionable queries.

**(Action: Click Upload. Select the 'Mercedes & Nvidia Partnership' image.)**

Finally, our **Visual Analysis**. I'm uploading a screenshot of the Mercedes-Nvidia partnership news.

**(Action: Show the specific insight generated from the image.)**

The agent analyzes the image pixel-by-pixel, understands the context, and gives you a specific breakdown of how this partnership impacts the stock.

**(Action: Switch back to camera or show the README architecture diagram.)**

That's EquityPulse. Thank you for watching, and please check out the detailed architecture diagrams in our README file!"
