Did you know 91% of retail traders lose money? Wall Street has armies of analysts; we have day jobs and Reddit tips. That changes today.

Meet **EquityPulse**: The "Hedge Fund in Your Pocket".

EquityPulse isn't just a chatbot—it's an **Autonomous Multi-Agent Platform** that simulates a professional investment committee. Instead of summarizing news, 5 specialized AI agents (Fundamental, Quant, Risk, Technical, and Management) debate every stock from every angle using **1 Million Token Context** via Google Gemini 3.0 Pro.

✨ **Key Features:**
🔹 **Real-Time Reasoning**: Watch agents debate NVIDIA's valuation live.
🔹 **Deep Dive Analysis**: 50+ Financial Parameters (ROIC, Altman Z-Score) analyzed instantly.
🔹 **Multimodal Intelligence**: Upload charts or partnership memos—our Vision Agent reads pixels like a pro.
🔹 **Voice Control**: Talk to your portfolio manager using Gemini 3.0 Flash.
