I've been investing in the equity markets for more than 8 years. And to be honest, I found myself unable to even beat the index funds.

When I researched this, I realized it's not just me. 91% of retail investors lose money.

Why? Because we are outgunned. Wall Street has teams of analysts; we have day jobs.

That's why I built EquityPulse. It is a Hedge Fund in Your Pocket.

Let me give you a demo. Let's run an analysis for one of our favorites: the AI giant, NVIDIA.

You can see the logs in real-time. This isn't a chatbot making things up; these are specialized agents—Fundamental, Quant, Risk, Technical—tracing their reasoning and debating the stock live.

Once it's done, you see the Portfolio Manager's Summary. It aggregates everything. For example, it gives an 8/10 on Valuation because it weighs the growth against the premium.

Let's look at the Technical Analysis. You see the Simple Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, and other indicators charted right here. It gives you the relative strength, not just the price action.

Now, the Fundamental Analysis. Most people only look at basic parameters like P/E ratios. Those are subjective and often misleading.

We consider 50+ Quantitative parameters and hundreds of qualitative items.

We verify these facts against the actual report. You can visually see the health of the company: Green is Good. Yellow is Moderate. Red is Dangerous.

This applies across all our agents.

This is where 90% of investors fail: Sector & Management Analysis.

Fundamentals tell you what happened. Sector analysis tells you what's coming—business cycles, headwinds, and tailwinds.

And Management Analysis is crucial. We assess qualitative terms—geopolitical risks, leadership integrity—that numbers simply miss.

We also have smart Annotations. You can highlight any text in the report to instantly ask the agent for clarification.

We use Gemini 3.0 Flash for our Voice-to-Text feature. It instantly converts speech into actionable queries.

Finally, our Visual Analysis. I'm uploading a screenshot of the Mercedes-Nvidia partnership news.

The agent analyzes the image pixel-by-pixel, understands the context, and gives you a specific breakdown of how this partnership impacts the stock.

That's EquityPulse. Thank you for watching, and please check out the detailed architecture diagrams in our README file!
